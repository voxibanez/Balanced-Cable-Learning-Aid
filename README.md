Balanced Cable Learning Aid

A learning aid created in Python and C for use with a Raspberry Pi. This tool demonstrates the difference in signal degredation when using a balanced vs unbalanced audio cable.

The tool was written in Python using tkinter to create a GUI. The driver was written in C and interfaces with the ADS1256 DAC/ADC, which then extends its functions to Python.

Other features include simulation mode that will simulate the signal degredation in a balanced and unbalanced cable, with adjustable noise parameters.
